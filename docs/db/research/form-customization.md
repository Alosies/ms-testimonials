# Form Customization Research

Research on form preview customization options offered by testimonial collection applications.

## Summary

Most testimonial apps do NOT offer multiple layout templates. They provide a single opinionated layout with color/branding customization. This represents a potential differentiation opportunity.

## Customization Categories

### 1. Layout Structure

| Layout Type | Description | Best For |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| One Question Per Page (Card/Conversational) | Guided, step-by-step experience | Longer forms (4-12 questions), testimonials |
| All Questions on One Page (Classic) | Everything visible at once | Short forms (<6 fields) |
| Multi-Column | Side-by-side fields | Contact info, compact forms |

**Industry Standard**: Most testimonial apps (Senja, Testimonial.to, Famewall) default to one-question-per-page for collection forms.

### 2. Color/Branding Customization

Common options across competitors:
- Background color
- Card/field colors
- Button colors
- Star rating colors
- Text colors
- Logo upload
- Hide/show platform branding (often paid feature)

### 3. Background Options

- Solid color
- Background image (full page or header)
- Transparent/minimal

### 4. Typography

- Font selection (limited)
- Text size adjustments

### 5. Form Field Customization

- Enable/disable specific fields
- Custom field labels
- Required vs optional fields
- Custom submit button text

## Competitor Analysis

### Senja
- Customizable collection forms with branding
- Color and font adjustments
- Multiple display formats for widgets
- Responsive designs
- No explicit layout templates mentioned

### Testimonial.to
- Branded, shareable landing page
- Video and text collection
- Wall of Love and individual widgets
- Focus on simplicity over customization depth

### Famewall
- 4 customization categories: Background, Card, Widget Settings, Header
- Card color, rating color, text size options
- Custom branding on paid plans
- **Limitation**: "If you want complete design control, you'll hit a wall. You can't fully change things like padding, font styles, text size."

### Jotform (General Form Builder)
- Classic Form (all questions) vs Card Form (one per page)
- Form Designer with colors, fonts, themes
- Logo and URL customization

### forms.app
- Step view vs list view toggle
- Ready-to-use themes
- Color and design customization

## What Competitors DON'T Offer

- Pre-built layout templates (e.g., "image left, form right" vs "centered")
- Advanced positioning control
- Padding/spacing customization
- Video vs text layout variations
- Split-view layouts

## UX Research: One Question Per Page vs All Questions

### When to Use One Question Per Page
- Service/product feedback surveys
- Likert scale heavy forms
- When friendlier, guided experience is desired
- Forms with 4-12 questions

### When to Use All Questions on One Page
- Only a few fields (users see how short it is)
- Users need to skip around or see all questions first
- Quick submissions

### The "Goldilocks Zone"
- More than 6 ratings: group by category, multi-page
- Conversational forms hurt conversion after 12-14 questions
- Page load times must be fast for one-per-page pattern

## Recommendation Options

### Option 1: MVP Approach (Lower Effort)
Ship a single, well-designed layout with color/brand customization only.
- Matches competitor baseline
- Faster to implement
- Lower maintenance

### Option 2: Differentiator Approach (Higher Effort)
Offer 2-3 layout presets:
- **Centered**: Standard layout (like competitors)
- **Split View**: Image/video on one side, form on other
- **Minimal/Immersive**: Full-width with background focus

Competitive advantage since layout templates aren't emphasized by competitors.
