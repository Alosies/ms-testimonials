## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Testimonials platform. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during development, including the context, decision, and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult because of this change?
