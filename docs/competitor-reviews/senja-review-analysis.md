# Senja - Review Analysis Report

**Generated:** 2025-12-29
**Platforms Analyzed:** G2, Product Hunt, Robby Miles Blog, Chrome Extension Reviews, Competitor Comparisons
**Total Reviews Analyzed:** 30+ reviews + editorial content

---

## Executive Summary

Senja is a testimonial collection and management platform founded by Olly (CEO/marketing) and Wilson (tech) in 2022. The product has grown to 300+ customers and ~$7.4K MRR through strong community building and "build in public" approach. Users praise its **generous free tier, beautiful UI, and ease of use**, but **slow-loading widgets and inconsistent support** are the primary pain points. Unlike SocialJuice (support crisis) or Testimonial.to (pricing concerns), Senja's issues are more about technical reliability than fundamental product problems.
